# WBA Builders Cohort

Welcome to the **WBA Builders Cohort Q3 2024**, which is my web3 developer adventure on the Solana blockchain. This cohort will provide the foundational knowledge and practical skills needed to navigate the evolving landscape of decentralized applications (dApps) in Solana.

## Cohort Overview

### **Introduction to TypeScript**

- Basics of TypeScript programming language.
- Understanding variables, data types, functions, and arrow functions.
- Exploring type inference, type assertions, advanced types, and interfaces.

### **Web3 Fundamentals**

- Journey through Web1, Web2, and the emergence of Web3.
- Introduction to the architecture of decentralized applications (dApps).

### **Solana's Architecture and Ecosystem**

- Deep dive into Solana's architecture, transactions, and account model.
- Hands-on experience with setting up the Solana development environment, creating keypairs, and claiming token airdrops.

### **Introduction to Rust**

- Fundamentals of Rust programming language.
- Concepts of ownership, basic data types, functions, and control flow.
- Introduction to the Anchor framework and building a "Hello World" program on Solana.

### **Interacting with Solana Programs and Frontend Integration**

- Step-by-step guide to building and integrating a dApp with Solana.
- Implementing state, defining instructions, and adding & updating reviews.
- Building, deploying, and integrating the frontend of our dApp.

### **Anchor Framework**

- Anchor is a framework for quickly building secure Solana programs.
- With Anchor we can build programs quickly because it writes various boilerplate for us such as (de)serialization of accounts and instruction data.
- We can build secure programs more easily because Anchor handles certain security checks for us. On top of that, it allows us to succinctly define additional checks and keep them separate from our business logic.
- Both of these aspects mean that instead of working on the tedious parts of raw Solana programs, we can spend more time working on what matters most, ours product.

## Key Learnings and Achievements

- Mastery over Solana Programs (Smart Contracts), Program Derived Addresses (PDAs), and Interface Definition Languages (IDLs).
- Proficiency in Native Rust & the Anchor Framework for building robust Solana Programs.
- Understanding of common errors and troubleshooting methods in Solana development.

## Personal Milestones

- Typescript Language
- Solana SDK
- Rust Language
- Anchor Framework
- Metaplex Token Programs
- Arweave Web3 Storage

Special thanks to the WBA - Turbin3 team who lets me in and give the opportunity to become a web3 developer in Solana blockchain.
